Example scripts that aren't yet documented
==========================================

As part of building the API I've prepared a bunch of examples that exercise
various parts of the code and various bits of hardware. Those scripts are
included in the examples directory, but many of them aren't documented yet.
They're still useful though!

Simple examples
---------------

The clock
    Uses Timer classes to display the current time on the number display.
    Flashes the colon once every half second, just like the clock on your
    microwave.

The discolights
    Shows how to use the wave modules to make the rainbow LEDs flash in pretty
    patterns.

Medium examples
---------------

Scrolling text
    First use of the matrix and all its madness (matrix)

The combination lock
    Use the rainbow and keypad to create a combination lock (rainbow
    and touch)

Advanced examples
-----------------

Following the line: A robot!
    Make a robot that follows a line... (2 light sensors, 2 motors, matrix, rainbow)
