Examples broken down by kit
===========================

The **blackpearl** documentation tries to explain all of the various bits both
of the hardware that comes with the Flotilla and its own internal components.
That means that some projects will require parts that you may not have if you
didn't get the Mega Treasure Chest.

This page breaks down the examples by kit.

The large starter kit comes with all the components from the mini and medium,
plus a motion sensor (accelerometer and magnetometer), a colour sensor, a dial,
