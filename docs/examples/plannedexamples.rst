Planned examples
================

Simple examples
---------------

Stopwatch
    Teaches how to use the timer things (number and touch)

The clock
    Teaches about the timer, and how to manipulate the number at a lower level
    (just the number)
    
The discolights
    Create a light show using the wave modules (just the rainbow)
    
Discolights++
    Add the keypad in to the mix, and let it change which lights are lit and
    invert some of the colours (rainbow and touch)

Medium examples
---------------

Discolights++
    Use of the rainbow, keypad and slider (or dial) to allow the user to control
    the speed of the show. Shows how Modules can interact with each other
    (rainbow, touch and slider)

Scrolling text
    First use of the matrix and all its madness (matrix)
    
Scrolling text++
    Let the dial alter the speed of the text, let the keypad pause and restart
    it (matrix and dial)
    
Advanced examples
-----------------

Scrolling text+++
    Let the dial alter the speed of the text, let the keypad pause and restart
    it, and blip the rainbow every time it loops. Teaches about non-hardware
    messages (matrix, dial and rainbow). Think about extending by adding the
    number to count the loops
    
The combination lock
    Use the rainbow and keypad to create a combination lock. Teaches about
    use of the Timer software module, plus more complex Python classes (rainbow
    and touch)
    
Following the line: A robot!
    Make a robot that follows a line... (2 light sensors, 2 motors)
    
Drop an anvil!
    Use the keypad to cause things to happen inside Minecraft (touch, plus
    Minecraft Pi)
    
Weather forecaster
    Get the weather from the internet and display it on the matrix (matrix plus
    URL fetcher)
